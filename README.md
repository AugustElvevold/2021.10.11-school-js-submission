## Usage
Upon launching `er-du-synsk.html`, players are greeted with a title and a choice of difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, Hard, or Custom. 

- **Easy Mode**: Grants players 12 lives to start the game.
- **Normal Mode**: Starts the game with the default 5 lives.
- **Hard Mode**: Challenges players with only 3 lives.
- **Custom Mode**: Allows players to enter the number of lives they want to start with.

In the game area, two boxes are displayed labeled "Denne?" and "Eller denne?". One of these boxes is the correct choice. If the player guesses correctly, their score of right answers is increased. If they guess wrong, a life is deducted from their remaining lives. The player can earn extra lives at specific score milestones. 

Winning the game requires the player to make 10 correct guesses before running out of lives. Upon winning, the screen displays a congratulatory message along with an option to restart the game. If the player loses all their lives, the game displays a message informing them of their loss, and again offering a restart option.

Throughout the gameplay, various sound effects accompany the actions, enhancing the interactive experience.
